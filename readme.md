# Password Generator

Hello there! In this project, I have developed a Random Password Generator. The Tech Stack for this project is : HTML, CSS & Javascript. Tailwind CSS could also be used.

# Features

This project includes the following features:

1) Generates a Random Password of length 1 to 20 including UpperCase characters, LowerCase characters, Symbols and Numbers.

2) A button representing the strength of the generated password. If the password's length is above 8, then it would be considered as Strong password, else Weak password. And according to the strength the color of the button would change from Green(Strong password) to Red(Weak password).

3) A Copy Button to copy the password to clipboard and paste it accordingly.

# Getting Started

To run the website locally, TailWind CSS must be configured on your machine and then you can follow these steps :

1) Clone the repository to your local machine.
2) Open the index.html file into your Code Editor like VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.
3) Open the terminal and run "npm run start".
4) In the terminal, you will see a local server, click on that.
5) Modify the HTML and Tailwind CSS files as needed to customize the website and setup Tailwind CSS on your project directory to get the benefits of it.

# Credits

The website design and content is based from the M.E.R.N. Stack Master Course of Love Babbar  with some modifications to fit the scope of this project.
